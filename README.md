First you want to run all of the .py files in 'far_code' folder besides full_far.py and new_far.py. After the files names {position}.py are run, run new_far.py. Then you can run the visualization notebook. 

There may be some problems with running the files since the read_csv lines in the files  are based off the directory on my local computer. Even though those files may not run, I included all of the CSV files that the scripts create in the repository. The important csv files are in the 'final' folder or in the 'to_visualize' folder.

scratch.pdf is a pdf of my visualization notebook.

Evaluating the Performance of NFL Contracts.pdf are my presentation slides.

The visualization I used and some other ones are in the vis folder.
